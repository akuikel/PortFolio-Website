Hello! I'm Aavash Kuikel, a passionate web development enthusiast currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

My primarly interest lies on backend engineering, however you'll also find me spending some time doing frontend. All in one I enjoy building dynamic and user-friendly applications.

Beyond my technical pursuits, I love traveling, trying new foods, and photography. These activities inspire me and broaden my perspective on the world.
