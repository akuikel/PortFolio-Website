I'm a passionate and dedicated software developer with a solid foundation in computer science and a love for web development.

Currently, I'm studying for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and primarily spend my time  exploring [backend development](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Web_Development/What_is_a_backend%3F) and solving computer science "whiteboarding" problems. 

Lately, I've also been exploring the exciting world of Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning.
