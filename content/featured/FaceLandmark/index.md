This script utilizes the Google GenAI Gemini API to analyze emotions within a journal entry, relying solely on a defined emotion tree structure. It then traces each emotion to its origin, whether root or child nodes, for deeper insights. Additionally, it provides future guidance akin to a therapist's advice, offering supportive recommendations based on the emotional analysis.
